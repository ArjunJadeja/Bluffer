## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Modern, concise and safe programming language
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - A concurrency design pattern to execute code asynchronously.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle - Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel - Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - LiveData - LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
  - ViewBinding - Binds UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Network)
- [Retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - Construct the REST APIs.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines
- [SoundPool](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/SoundPool) - Manages and plays audio resources for applications.
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material design components for building View layouts and Animations.
