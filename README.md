## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle - Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel - Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - DataBinding - Binds UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
  - Room Persistence - Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model)
  - [Bindables](https://github.com/skydoves/bindables) - Android DataBinding kit for notifying data changes to UI layers.
  - Repository Pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - Construct the REST APIs.
- [Sandwich](https://github.com/skydoves/Sandwich) - Construct a lightweight and modern response interface to handle network payload for Android.
